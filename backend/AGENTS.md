# AGENTS.md

## Project Overview

The backend runs a LangGraph-based super agent with sandbox execution, persistent memory, subagent delegation, and extensible tools in isolated per-thread environments.

**Architecture**:
- **Gateway API** (port 8001): REST API plus embedded LangGraph-compatible agent runtime
- **Frontend** (port 3000): Next.js web interface
- **Nginx** (port 2026): Unified reverse proxy entry point
- **Provisioner** (port 8002, optional in Docker dev): Started only when sandbox is configured for provisioner/Kubernetes mode

**Voice input**: server-side speech-to-text lives in `packages/harness/deerflow/community/speech/` (see its `AGENTS.md`); the cloud tier is off by default and Tailscale CGNAT counts as local.

**Runtime**: the run path (RunManager + `run_agent()` + StreamBridge), stream
frames and subgraph namespacing, subagent identity, scheduled-task dispatch and
occurrence states, the MCP durable task runtime, and the `extensions_config.json`
write path each carry invariants that are silent when broken. They are reference
material rather than orientation, so they live in
[docs/RUNTIME.md](docs/RUNTIME.md) — read it before changing any of them.

ATX outline closing markers use a linear suffix scan; do not use unanchored
whitespace regex searches on unbounded uploaded headings. The long-heading
regression exercises the production extractor under a generous process deadline.

## Important Development Guidelines

### Documentation Update Policy
Every code change must keep docs accurate and current: update `README.md` for
user-facing behavior and the relevant `AGENTS.md` for development changes.
`CLAUDE.md` imports `AGENTS.md`; do not edit the shim.

### Backend Benchmarks

`scripts/benchmark/` holds standalone, reproducible measurements of production
backend behavior. The dataset-pinning, secret-handling, determinism and
result-publishing rules — the DeerMem eviction evaluation's commands, and the
`context_snapshot/` protocol (`run-live` needs provider env vars; `summarize`
and pytest are offline) — live beside the code in
[scripts/benchmark/AGENTS.md](scripts/benchmark/AGENTS.md).

`scripts/benchmark/concurrency/` measures multi-process contention on the
`users` table (N separate OS processes, not asyncio tasks) for SQLite vs
Postgres -- the scenario `CONFIGURATION.md` requires Postgres for. `worker.py`
connects directly via SQLAlchemy (skipping the ~8.5s Alembic bootstrap the
orchestrator already ran once) and mirrors the app's per-connection SQLite
PRAGMAs; `run_concurrency_bench.py` seeds a disposable per-run Postgres schema,
synchronises workers on a READY/GO barrier before timing, and exits non-zero on
any crash, short op count, or `errors > 0`. Postgres runs need a throwaway
database via `--pg-url`; nothing here touches `public`. Run from `backend/`:

```bash
uv run python scripts/benchmark/concurrency/run_concurrency_bench.py \
  --backend sqlite --workers 2,4,8,16 --ops-per-worker 50 --read-ratio 0.7
uv run pytest tests/test_bench_concurrency.py tests/test_bench_worker.py -q
```

## Commands

**Root directory** (for full application):
```bash
make check      # Check system requirements
make install    # Install all dependencies (frontend + backend)
make extension-install SOURCE=...  # Install and enable a trusted Python extension
make extension-upgrade SOURCE=...  # Replace an installed extension and keep its config
make extension-list                # List configured Python extensions
make extension-enable NAME=...     # Enable an installed extension
make extension-disable NAME=...    # Disable an extension without uninstalling it
make extension-remove NAME=...     # Remove a managed extension
make detect-thread-boundaries  # Inventory backend executor/thread/event-loop boundaries
make dev        # Start all services (Gateway + Frontend + Nginx), with config.yaml preflight
make start      # Start production services locally
make stop       # Stop all services
```

**Backend directory** (for backend development only):
```bash
make install            # Install backend dependencies
make dev                # Gateway API, reload (port 8001)
make gateway            # Gateway API only (port 8001)
make test               # offline tests (no live/blocking-io)
make test-live          # live tests (real APIs)
make test-blocking-io   # strict Blockbuster gate on tests/blocking_io/
make test-shard SPLITS=4 GROUP=2  # one duration-aware shard
make test-shard-durations  # refresh baseline
make lint               # ruff lint
make format             # ruff format
make migrate-rev MSG="..."  # Autogenerate a new alembic revision (see Schema Migrations section)
```

The backend `make dev` target pre-creates and excludes `DEER_FLOW_HOME`
(default: `backend/.deer-flow`) and `backend/sandbox` from Uvicorn's reload
watcher. Do not replace it with a bare `uvicorn --reload`: agent tasks write
Python and other runtime files below `DEER_FLOW_HOME`, which would otherwise
restart the Gateway during an active run.

More specific `AGENTS.md` files in backend code directories contain the subsystem sections split from this file. Follow the nearest file in the directory tree.

## Architecture

### Harness / App Split

The backend is split into two layers with a strict dependency direction:

- **Harness** (`packages/harness/deerflow/`): Publishable agent framework package (`deerflow-harness`). Import prefix: `deerflow.*`. Contains agent orchestration, tools, sandbox, models, MCP, skills, config — everything needed to build and run agents.
- **App** (`app/`): Unpublished application code. Import prefix: `app.*`. Contains the FastAPI Gateway API and IM channel integrations (Feishu, Slack, Telegram, DingTalk).

**Dependency rule**: App imports deerflow, but deerflow never imports app. This boundary is enforced by `tests/test_harness_boundary.py` which runs in CI.

**Import conventions**:
```python
# Harness internal
from deerflow.agents import make_lead_agent
from deerflow.models import create_chat_model

# App internal
from app.gateway.app import app
from app.channels.service import start_channel_service

# App → Harness (allowed)
from deerflow.config import get_app_config

# Harness → App (FORBIDDEN — enforced by test_harness_boundary.py)
# from app.gateway.routers.uploads import ...  # ← will fail CI
```

Package import hygiene: the `deerflow.agents` and `deerflow.subagents` package
roots expose heavyweight graph/executor entrypoints lazily. The
`deerflow.agents:make_lead_agent` LangGraph Server entrypoint is a concrete thin
module-level function because the server resolves graph factories directly from
the module dictionary; the wrapper keeps the lead-agent and skill-cache imports
inside the function so importing the package remains lightweight. Internal
modules that only need lightweight types, config, or registries should import
the concrete submodule instead of adding eager package-root imports that pull in
the tool graph or subagent executor during state/schema imports.

`ThreadMetaStore.search()` keeps JSON filter semantics identical across memory,
SQLite, and PostgreSQL: missing differs from null, bool differs from int, and
float filters accept integer or real JSON numbers through `json_value_matches`.

### Gateway Run-Context Trust Boundary

Gate server-owned run context on both client feeds (`body.context` and
`body.config`): `merge_run_context_overrides` admits it only for `internal=True`,
while `strip_internal_context_keys` scrubs both destinations. Treat
`disable_clarification` like `non_interactive`. Before run/state writes,
`_normalize_input_messages` rejects canonical external system/developer roles;
only `AUTH_SOURCE_INTERNAL` run input may retain them.

## Development Workflow

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) — MANDATORY

**Every new feature or bug fix MUST be accompanied by unit tests. No exceptions.**

- Write tests in `backend/tests/` following the existing naming convention `test_<feature>.py`
- Run both offline targets before and after your change: `make test` and `make test-blocking-io`
- Tests must pass before a feature is considered complete
- For lightweight config/utility modules, prefer pure unit tests with no external dependencies
- If a module causes circular import issues in tests, add a `sys.modules` mock in `tests/conftest.py` (see existing example for `deerflow.subagents.executor`)

```bash
# Run default offline tests
make test

# Run strict blocking-I/O tests
make test-blocking-io

# Explicit live integration tests (requires config.yaml and credentials;
# calls real APIs and may create local side effects)
make test-live

# Run a specific test file
PYTHONPATH=. uv run pytest tests/test_<feature>.py -v
```

Keep live tests opt-in via `DEER_FLOW_RUN_LIVE_TESTS=1`; guard POSIX-only
markers with `os.name` for Windows collection.

Jina logging tests use dummy keys (`tests/test_jina_client.py`).
Jina/Browserless/InfoQuest resolve URLs without rebuilding HTML.
InfoQuest connect/read timeout is 30s, separate from crawl timeouts (`tests/test_infoquest_http_timeout.py`).

### Running the Full Application

Run `make dev` from the repo root to start all services at `http://localhost:2026`.

**All startup modes:**

| | **Local Foreground** | **Local Daemon** | **Docker Dev** | **Docker Prod** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Dev** | `./scripts/serve.sh --dev`<br/>`make dev` | `./scripts/serve.sh --dev --daemon`<br/>`make dev-daemon` | `./scripts/docker.sh start`<br/>`make docker-start` | — |
| **Prod** | `./scripts/serve.sh --prod`<br/>`make start` | `./scripts/serve.sh --prod --daemon`<br/>`make start-daemon` | — | `./scripts/deploy.sh`<br/>`make up` |

| Action | Local | Docker Dev | Docker Prod |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stop** | `./scripts/serve.sh --stop`<br/>`make stop` | `./scripts/docker.sh stop`<br/>`make docker-stop` | `./scripts/deploy.sh down`<br/>`make down` |
| **Restart** | `./scripts/serve.sh --restart [flags]` | `./scripts/docker.sh restart` | — |

**Nginx routing**:
- `/api/langgraph/*` → Gateway embedded runtime (8001), rewritten to `/api/*`
- `/api/*` (other) → Gateway API (8001)
- `/` (non-API) → Frontend (3000)

### Running Backend Services Separately

From the **backend** directory:

```bash
# Gateway API
make gateway
```

Direct access (without nginx):
- Gateway: `http://localhost:8001`

### Frontend Configuration

The frontend uses environment variables to connect to backend services:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGGRAPH_BASE_URL` - Defaults to `/api/langgraph` (through nginx)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_BASE_URL` - Defaults to empty string (through nginx)

When using `make dev` from root, the frontend automatically connects through nginx.

## Key Features

### Web Search Recency

DDG, Brave, Tavily, SearXNG, and Sofya `web_search` share optional
`time_range=day|week|month|year`; omission preserves request shape. DDG maps to
`d|w|m|y`, Brave to `pd|pw|pm|py`, Tavily/SearXNG pass values unchanged, and
Sofya passes them unchanged as `freshness`.
For recency, DDGS 9.14.1 uses only enabled Brave, DuckDuckGo, and Yahoo engines
that honor `timelimit`: `auto`/`all` resolves to this set, incompatible configured
engines are removed, and an empty set falls back to it. Re-check on DDGS upgrades.

### Tavily Fetch

Title fallback: result URL, then request URL.

### File Upload

Outlines use ATX syntax (1–6 hashes, space/tab separator, ≤3 leading spaces), strip closing hashes and skip fenced code.
- Endpoint: `POST /api/threads/{thread_id}/uploads`
- Supports: PDF, PPT, Excel, Word (converted via `pymupdf4llm`/`markitdown`)
- Rejects directory inputs before copying so uploads stay all-or-nothing
- Reuses one conversion worker per request when called from a live event loop
- Files stored in thread-isolated directories under the resolving user's bucket (`users/{user_id}/threads/{thread_id}/user-data/uploads`). For IM channels the owner is threaded explicitly via the `user_id=` kwarg (see IM Channels → Owner-scoped file storage); HTTP/embedded callers resolve it from `get_effective_user_id()`
- Duplicate filenames within one request get `_N` suffixes to prevent overwrites.
- Gateway HTTP uploads stage `.upload-*.part` files, hidden from upload listings, agent context, and sandbox listings/searches. After size validation, publication is atomic; staged-name cleanup logs errors and leaves leftovers for startup sweep.
- Gateway HTTP upload/list/delete handlers offload filesystem work through `deerflow.utils.file_io.run_file_io`, a dedicated ContextVar-preserving file IO executor. Non-mounted sandbox uploads acquire sandboxes with `SandboxProvider.acquire_async()` and offload `read_bytes()` plus `sandbox.update_file()` together.
- Mounted uploads skip sandbox acquire/sync. AIO remote/provisioner requires accurate `sandbox.thread_data_mounts: true`; omission keeps backend auto-detection.
- `UploadsMiddleware` caps outline titles at 200 characters and previews at 2000 including markers. Titles use `original_user_content`, not upload-prefixed content; attachment-only titles use a sanitized, bounded filename or count.
- Long docs, scanned PDFs: [documents/AGENTS.md](packages/harness/deerflow/documents/AGENTS.md)

See [docs/FILE_UPLOAD.md](docs/FILE_UPLOAD.md) for details.

### Plan Mode

`config.configurable.is_plan_mode=True` enables TodoList `write_todos` for
multi-step tasks: one `in_progress` task, real-time updates. See
[usage](docs/plan_mode_usage.md).

### Run Interaction Policy

Interaction-sensitive changes must follow [policy](docs/RUN_INTERACTION_POLICY.md).

### Context Summarization

Automatic conversation summarization when approaching token limits:
- Configured in `config.yaml` under `summarization` key
- Trigger types: tokens, messages, or fraction of max input
- Keeps recent messages while summarizing older ones
- Manual compaction uses `POST /api/threads/{id}/compact`, reuses the same
  `DeerFlowSummarizationMiddleware`, writes a new checkpoint with updated
  `messages` and `summary_text`, and bumps only those channel versions.
  The route uses the shared `reserve_checkpoint_write()` boundary (also used by
  manual state updates). Its short-lived `checkpoint_write` thread operation
  shares the durable active-thread uniqueness constraint with run admission,
  preventing either worker-local or cross-worker checkpoint-write races.

See [docs/summarization.md](docs/summarization.md) for details.

### Vision Support

For models with `supports_vision: true`:
- `ViewImageMiddleware` processes images in conversation
- `view_image_tool` added to agent's toolset
- Images are converted to base64 and appended to the model request as a hidden message carrying both a reserved ID prefix and a server-owned metadata marker; Gateway strips that marker from untrusted input, and the middleware requires both identifiers to recognize its own message. The middleware injects inside `wrap_model_call`, so the payload never enters graph state: checkpoints retain only lightweight `viewed_images` metadata, while client-chosen IDs survive. It also sweeps its own message out of every request before rebuilding it, so a payload stranded in an older checkpoint by an interrupted run stops being resent

## Code Style

- Uses `ruff` for linting and formatting
- Line length: 240 characters
- Python 3.12+ with type hints
- Double quotes, space indentation

## Agent Generation (`app/gateway/routers/agent_generation.py`)

`POST /api/agent-generation/analyze` asks one model whether a user's own
conversations / scheduled tasks warrant a NEW custom agent. Read-only by design:
it returns a draft, never an agent. Invariants live in
[`deerflow/agents/generation/AGENTS.md`](packages/harness/deerflow/agents/generation/AGENTS.md).

## Fork-specific backend features

This fork adds backend behaviour upstream does not have: durable auxiliary token
counters, currency spend caps (`SpendBudgetMiddleware`, HTTP 402 at admission),
the spend attribution endpoint, cost-aware subagent routing, model fallback
chains, explicit `price:`/`discount:` model fields with a self-expiring
discount, Web Push delivery, multi-user mode, the per-user UI-state store, and an
editable lead-agent system prompt (`lead_agent/system_prompt_store.py`; the
invariants live in `packages/harness/deerflow/agents/AGENTS.md`).

Local image/video generation through a ComfyUI service — with its GPU
residency arbiter and self-critiquing refine loop — lives in
`packages/harness/deerflow/community/comfyui/`; its invariants are in that
package's own `AGENTS.md`.

Each is documented in **[FORK.md](../FORK.md)** with its rationale, its
invariants, and a row in the post-sync feature checklist naming the tests that
pin it. Read that file before changing any of them — several carry properties
that are silent when broken (token attribution on a fallback, the expiry rule on
a discount, the factory exclude set). Code-adjacent notes also live beside the
code, e.g. `packages/harness/deerflow/models/AGENTS.md` for pricing and fallback.
